# Running Speed Prediction Using Lumo Run IMU
Code repository for Lumo Run running speed prediction project

## Insructions

- Code was written using Jupyter notebooks and Python 3.6. Please consult file "Codebase/SpeedPrediction_FFCN_CNN_keras.ipynb" for a discription of necessary modules and libraries.

### Notes
- All data files have been removed from the repository for due to restrictions on data access. For this reason, expect all code written that is linked to anticipated folders/files to fail.
- Codebase : Folder contains code (i.e. Python scripts) to build neural networks models
