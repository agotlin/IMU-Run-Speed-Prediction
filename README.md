# lumo
Code repository for Lumo Run project

This will be filled in as code and other documents get added to the repository (AG - 07/10/2018)

Folders
- CS230 Documents : contains relevant documents from the CS230 course project on Lumo (from Adam Gotlin, Mike Hittle, and Sal Calvo). These documents should be Copy/Pasted out of this folder for future work (i.e. as opposed to editing documents directly in this folder). Thus, this folder acts as a checkpoint for files as of the end-date of the course project.
- Codebase : Folder contains code (i.e. Python scripts) to build neural networks models
